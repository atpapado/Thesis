Unsupervised Super Resolution for Sentinel-2 satellite imagery

In this work two unsupervised deep learning models were utilized for Super Resolving satellite imagery obtained from Sentinel-2 constellation. 

## 1. Deep Image Prior (DIP) 
The original implementation of this model was proposed by [Ulyanov et al.](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/deep-image-prior) 

### Requirments 
- python == 3.8
- earthpy
- numpy
- pytorch
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- gdal
- rasterio
- jupyter notebook

## 2. Zero-Shot Super Resolution (Î–SSR)
The original implementation of this model was proposed by [Shocher et al.](https://github.com/assafshocher/ZSSR) 

### Requirments 
- python == 2.7
- numpy
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- opencv-python
- imageio
